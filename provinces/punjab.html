                Minar-e-Pakistan is a historical monument in Lahore. It is considered as the largest tower in Pakistan. Minar-e-Pakistan is the place where Lahore resolution was passed which was the official call for a separate homeland for the Muslims of South Asia in the result of two nation theory. 

                Minar-e-Pakistan which is also known as the “Tower of Pakistan” is an open landmark placed in Iqbal Park in Lahore, Pakistan. The tower was built throughout the 1960s on the site where, on 23 March 1940, the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, the first official call for a differentiate country for the Muslims living in the South Asia, as per the two country theory. The tower reflects a mix of Mughal, Islamic and present day structural engineering.

            The King of all mosques in Lahore the Badshahi Mosque ruled over the throne of being the world’s largest mosque for over 313 years in history. The grandeur of the mosque can be adjudged by the fact that for the first 70 years after its construction in 1673, the mosque was simply known for its exceptional and extraordinary size which was visible from almost ten miles away! No doubt that the mosque was so significant back in the day and still is! Even today this historical and holy artifact speaks for itself as it stands with great splendor and magnificence.

            Every evening since 1959 (except for a brief period when they were at war) India and Pakistan have undertaken a nightly border closing ceremony at the Wagah crossing. It has become infamous for being a strange spectacle of overt nationalism, and involving very tall men from the Border Security Force on the Indian side and the Pakistan Rangers on the other, doing some serious goose stepping.
            It was wickedly hot as we left the hotel and negotiated with an auto-rickshaw driver to take us on the 50 minutes journey. When we arrived at 3:30pm the queues were massive. Everything we’d read said there are thousands that attend on the India side but only hundreds on the Pakistani side. We’d gone on a Sunday, and this definitely wasn’t the case. We joined the women’s queue and made some new friends. The gates opened 15 minutes later and we started the 2km journey through 3 security checks in the searing heat.
