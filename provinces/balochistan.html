                Ormara is an old coastal town. Its historical routes are linked with Alexander the Great, who stayed here with his army for a few days on his way back from the Indus region after conquering Sindh, Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regions in 400 BC. One of his generals, Ormoz, died there, and the present-day city was named after him. For a few centuries, Ormara remained a battle field between the Baloch Sardar (local feudal) and foreign aggressors. Before independence, it was part of the State of Lasbela and afterward it became part of Makran Division.
