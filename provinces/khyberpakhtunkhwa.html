            <p id="#Kaghan Valley">
                Kaghan valley is considered to be a jewel amongst the beautiful valleys of the Mansehra district in Pakistan. The valley is approximately 160 kilometers long and is a popular summer holiday resort for tourists from both within the country and abroad.
                The popular languages spoken in the valley are Hindko and Gojri while the national language Urdu is also widely understood. Kaghan valley is situated at an approximate distance of 250 kilometers from the capital, Islamabad. The road that leads to the valley passes through different towns and cities, notably Taxila, Abbotabad, Mansehra and Balakot.  The last city/town that comes before the start of Kaghan valley is Balakot.
Balakot was the place of an important historical battle between the Sikhs and Muslims in the early 19th century and is also home to the grave of Syed Ahmed Shaheed, an important Muslim leader. Tourists coming from far flung areas usually prefer to stay at Balakot for the night before officially venturing into the scenic valleys of Kaghan.

            <p id="Masjid Muhabbat Khan">
                Mahabat Khan Mosque stands today in the old city of Andar Shehr Bazaar, Peshawar, KPK. It is the best masterpiece of Mughal architecture and a holy place of tourists attraction.
                Emperor Shahjahan constructed it during his reign in 1670 AD. According to some historians, the King used Mahabat Khan Mosque’s tall minarets to hang criminals as a substitute for gallows. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, tribal chiefs would convene at the Mosque to rally the Afghan people against the Soviets. In addition, an entrance to the Mosque leads to a vast prayer courtyard.

            <p id="Khyber Pass">
                Crossing the Khyber has always been something of an adventure. Even in peacetime, this was a fairly wild region where banditry and tribal warfare were part of local history and almost every adult male went armed. Today, with the region in the center of an ongoing armed conflict, it is clearly far too dangerous for most.

                The area is inhabited by Pathans or Pashtuns, rather fierce Pashto-speaking hill tribes. On the map, it was a border region of the British Raj and is now part of Pakistan, but neither the British nor the Pakistani government have ever fully controlled it; Pathan tribal chiefs run everything. Pashtun territory spans the border. 60% of them live in Pakistan, 40% in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, they are the largest ethnic group at 40-odd% of the population and have often dominated government and business.
                
                The Pashtuns have twice defeated the greatest armies of their day. When Alexander the Great wanted to cross the pass, he could not manage it until he bribed some Pashtuns to assist him against others. Later the pass was the border of the British Raj; Britain fought several wars in the area and never completely subdued it. In the first Afghan war (1839-1842), at the height of British power in Queen Victoria's reign, a force of 16,000 (4500 soldiers plus grooms, cooks, etc.) went in and one man came out alive. Flashman is a fine historical novel about the campaign.

            <p id="Bala Hissar Fort">
                The word Bala Hissar is derived from Persian and means “elevated or high fort”. The name was given by the Afghan Pashtun King Timur Shah Durrani (1773–1793) and till now it is known by the same name, although the name was changed during the Sikh rule. This historic fort Bala Hisar sits on a high mound in the northwestern corner of Peshawar city. The fort was used as a royal residence for the Durrani Empire, and was rebuilt during Sikh and British rules.

                The fort used to be noticeably away from the old city of Peshawar, but now with the construction of new buildings space between the old city and the fort has been covered. However, the fort’s position on a high mound gives a powerful and panoramic view of Peshawar and the entire valley which is mesmerizing. If you happen to be in Peshawar on a clear sunny day, you will see the mountains around the Peshawar valley. View of the valley from this place is another mesmerizing sight.
                
                This fort covers an area of about 10 acres (40,000 m2) and the height of the fort is about 90 feet above ground level. The interesting fact is that the main entrance of the fort directly faces the ancient route to India.
